A static site generator specifically designed for developer portfolios. Astro's partial hydration approach delivers lightning-fast pages with minimal JavaScript.

Content is written in Markdown with frontmatter for metadata, making it easy to add projects, blog posts, and work experience. Multiple themes are available, and custom CSS variables allow personalization.

The build process optimizes images, generates responsive sizes, and creates an RSS feed. Deployment is automated to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel with a single command.
