A modern task management application inspired by Trello and Notion. Built with Vue 3 Composition API for reactive state management and smooth user interactions.

The drag-and-drop functionality uses the native HTML5 API with custom animations for a polished feel. Tasks can be organized into boards, lists, and cards with support for labels, due dates, and assignees.

Firebase provides real-time synchronization across devices, so team members see updates instantly. Authentication supports email/password and Google sign-in. Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with a consistent design system.
