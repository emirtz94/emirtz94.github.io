A recipe discovery app that helps users find meals based on ingredients they have, dietary restrictions, or cuisine preferences. The GraphQL API allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching.

MongoDB's flexible schema accommodates recipes with varying structures and attributes. Full-text search enables finding recipes by name, ingredient, or description. Users can save favorites, create collections, and plan weekly meals.

Nutritional information is calculated automatically based on ingredients and serving sizes. The meal planner generates shopping lists and estimates total prep time for the week.
