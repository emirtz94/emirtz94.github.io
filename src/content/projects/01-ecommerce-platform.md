This e-commerce platform was built to provide a seamless shopping experience from browsing to checkout. The frontend uses React with a component-based architecture, making it easy to maintain and extend.

Key features include a dynamic product catalog with filtering and search, a persistent shopping cart using local storage, and secure checkout powered by Stripe. The backend API handles inventory management, order processing, and user authentication with JWT tokens.

The admin dashboard allows store owners to manage products, view sales analytics, and process orders. Performance optimizations include lazy loading for images, code splitting, and server-side rendering for SEO.
