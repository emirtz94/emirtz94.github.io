This project is a full-stack Todo application developed with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, using Handlebars for server-side rendering and MySQL as the database.

It includes session-based authentication, modular routing, and centralized error handling. The application serves Bootstrap assets for responsive UI development and exposes authentication state globally to templates, enabling dynamic and user-aware views.
