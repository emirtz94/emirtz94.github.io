A comprehensive weather dashboard that provides current conditions, hourly forecasts, and 7-day predictions. TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the codebase, catching errors at compile time.

The app integrates with OpenWeather API for accurate meteorological data. Users can search for any city or use geolocation for automatic detection. Interactive charts built with Chart.js visualize temperature trends, precipitation probability, and wind patterns.

Additional features include severe weather alerts, air quality index, UV index, and sunrise/sunset times. The responsive design works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.
